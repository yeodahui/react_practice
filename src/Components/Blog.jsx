      <p>
        Our next major version, React 18, is available today as a Release
        Candidate (RC). As we shared at React Conf, React 18 introduces features
        powered by our new concurrent renderer, with a gradual adoption strategy
        for existing applications. In this post, we will guide you through the
        steps for upgrading to React 18.
